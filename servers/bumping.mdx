Bumping your server moves it to the top of the server list, increasing visibility and attracting new players. This is one of the most effective ways to grow your community.

## What is Bumping?

Bumping temporarily boosts your server's position in the Rankly server list. When you bump:
- Your server appears at the top of search results
- New players discover your server first
- You get increased traffic from platform visitors

## How to Bump

### Step 1: Authorize the Rankly Bot

First, authorize the Rankly bot to your Discord server using this link:

<Card icon="link" href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1435159437131124806&integration_type=0&scope=applications.commands">
  Authorize Rankly Bot
</Card>

<Tip>
  The Rankly bot requires **no permissions** and takes **no bot slots**. We only authorize chat commands, keeping your server lean and secure.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Use the /bump Command

Once authorized, simply type the command in any channel:

```
/bump
```

Your server will be bumped immediately and moved to the top of the server list.

## Bump Frequency

You can bump your server every 30 minutes. There's a 30-minute cooldown between bumps, so plan your bumping strategy accordingly.

## Auto-Bump Subscription

Don't want to manually bump every 30 minutes? Enable **auto-bump** from your dashboard:

  <Card title="Cost">500 credits per week</Card>
  <Card title="Frequency">Every 30 minutes automatically</Card>
  <Card title="Duration">7 days, auto-renews</Card>
  <Card title="Bumps">~336 per week</Card>
</CardGroup>

Auto-bump keeps your server consistently visible without manual effort. Perfect for servers with steady credit earnings or those wanting guaranteed top placement.

<Info>
Auto-bump is the most efficient way to maintain visibility. Learn more in the [Spending Credits](/servers/spending-credits) guide.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to grant permissions?">
    No. The Rankly bot requires no permissions - it only serves slash commands and doesn't need access to your server.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does the bot take up a bot slot?">
    No. The Rankly bot is registered as an app with chat commands only, so it doesn't consume a bot slot in your server.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does a bump last?">
    A bump places your server at the top immediately. The duration depends on how many other servers are bumped after yours, but you can bump again after the 30-minute cooldown.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the bump cooldown?">
    There's a 30-minute cooldown between bumps. After bumping, you must wait 30 minutes before bumping again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I use auto-bump instead?">
    If you have credits, auto-bump is more efficient. For 500 credits/week, your server bumps automatically every 30 minutes (~336 times/week) without manual effort.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I don't see the /bump command?">
    Make sure the bot is authorized to your server using the authorization link. If you've just authorized it, try leaving and rejoining your server to refresh the command list.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I automate bumping?">
    Yes! Enable auto-bump from your dashboard to automate bumps every 30 minutes. This costs 500 credits/week and requires no manual effort. Alternatively, set reminders and bump manually with the /bump command.
