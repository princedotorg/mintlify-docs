Learn how to earn credits through user votes and community engagement metrics.

## Vote Credits

Every vote your server receives earns credits:

```
1 vote = 0.1 credits
```

### Requirements

Your server must meet these criteria to earn vote credits:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Server Age** | At least 12 hours old |
| **Members** | At least 250 members |
| **Voter** | Verified user |
| **Frequency** | User hasn't voted in last 12 hours |

<Tip>
Servers below 250 members can still receive votes—they just won't earn credits until they grow.
</Tip>

### Maximizing Vote Earnings

**Promote Your Rankly Page**

- Share link in #welcome channel
- Add to Discord server discovery
- Mention in announcements

**Build an Active Community**

<Info>

## Session Credits

Earn daily rewards based on community engagement quality.

### How It Works

Your server receives a session credit evaluation every day at **4:00 AM UTC** based on the previous day's activity:

- **Session Duration** - How long users spend on your listing
- **Unique Users** - Number of different visitors
- **Tier Level** - Determines credits awarded

### Earning Tiers

## Credit Priority

When your server earns credits from both votes and sessions:

```
Earned Credits (votes)
     ↓
Session Credits (engagement)
     ↓
Purchased Credits (optional purchase)
```

Spend earned credits first since they expire in 90 days.
