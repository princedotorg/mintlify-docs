Discover the different ways to spend your credits and boost your server's visibility.

## Overview

Your credits can be spent on several premium features. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature | Cost | Duration | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| **Featured Spot** | Variable | 1 week | One-time visibility boost |
| **Auto-Bump** | 500 | 7 days | Consistent visibility |
| **Bot Premium** | Varies | Per plan | Bot feature unlocks |
| **Credit Burn** | Any | Permanent | Platform support |

<Tip>
Most servers use a combination of featured spots and auto-bump for maximum visibility.
</Tip>

## Featured Spots

Bid in weekly auctions for premium homepage placement.

### How It Works

- **Auction Period:** Monday 00:00 UTC → Sunday 23:59 UTC
- **Winners:** Top 3 bidders
- **Placement:** The following week
- **Visibility:** Prominently featured on homepage

### Strategy

**Timing**
- Bid early if you want guaranteed placement
- Bid late (Sunday evening) for lower competition
- Adjust bids up to auction end

**Budgeting**
- Set a maximum bid amount
- Track your ROI (votes gained vs credits spent)
- Experiment with different bid amounts

**Combined Approach**
- Use featured spots for big events
- Use auto-bump for baseline visibility
- Stack both when budget allows

### Losing Bids

If your bid doesn't win, credits are refunded as **session credits** (not earned credits).

<Info>
You can always bid again next week. Don't worry about losing bids—your credits come back.
</Info>

## Auto-Bump Subscription

Keep your server at the top of listings continuously.

### Details

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Cost** | 500 credits |
| **Duration** | 7 days, auto-renews |
| **Bumps** | Every 30 minutes (~336/week) |
| **Effect** | Moved to top of relevant listings |

### When to Use

**Best For:**
- Consistent, long-term visibility
- Servers with steady growth
- Maintaining momentum
- Budget-conscious servers

**How It Works:**
1. Enable auto-bump from dashboard
2. 500 credits deducted automatically
3. Server bumped every 30 minutes
4. Renews weekly if you have credits
5. Pauses if credits run out

<Warning>
Auto-bump requires 500 credits weekly. If you run out mid-week, bumping pauses until you earn or purchase more credits.
</Warning>

### Cost Comparison

Auto-bump is more economical than single featured spot bids for sustained visibility:

```
1 week of auto-bump:
500 credits + ~336 bumps = consistent visibility

VS

1 week of featured spot:
Variable bid (could be 500-2000+) + 1 premium placement
= single boost, then back to normal
```

## Bot Premium

Unlock premium features for partner bots.

### How It Works

- **Per-Bot Pricing** - Each bot sets its own price
- **Instant Activation** - Premium activates immediately
- **Duration** - Varies by bot (weekly, monthly, lifetime)
- **Platform Fee** - Dynamic fee applies to all purchases

### Finding Bot Premium

1. Visit partner bot pages on Rankly
2. Check available premium features
3. View pricing and duration
4. Purchase with your credits

<Info>
Partner bot features vary widely. Check the bot's page for specific details about what premium unlocks.
</Info>

## Credit Burn

Support Rankly by permanently burning (destroying) credits.

### Details

- **Effect:** Credits removed from circulation
- **Refund:** None—permanent donation
- **Tracking:** Total burn amount shown on your profile
- **Purpose:** Platform appreciation and inflation control

### Why Burn?

- Show support for the platform
- Help reduce credit inflation
- Earn a "supporter" badge (coming soon)
- Give back to the community

<Tip>
Burning is optional and voluntary. Only do it if you want to support Rankly's ecosystem.
